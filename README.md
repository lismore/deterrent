# Deterrent

Deterrent is a Cyber Security Platform using AI for advanced persistent threat detection &amp; automatic adversarial attack

The foundation platform is open source, it enables security professionals, startups, small businesses and large enterprises to stand up a base platform upon which to develop cutting edge innovative cyber detect and attack capabilities.

# Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning / Deep Learning 

The Deterrant Platform uses research, techniques and coding solutions from data science and machine learning to train intelligent systems to detect unusual or anomalous behaviour typically seen with malicious intrusions, malicious insider behaviour and advanced persistent threats that play the long game to compromise targets of interest.

# Automated Attack Capabilities 

There are many great tools available to security professionals to help automate vulnerability scanning, fingerprinting & enumeration of operating systems and services, even automated attack tools. The deterrant platform fuses data from sensors across the deployed network and hosts with machine and deep learning algorithms providing a constant stream of live real time intelligence data upon which cyber deterrant capabilities can be directed and focused for scanning and attacking a target of evaluation.  

# Reporting 

A dashboard providing real time intelligence insight and actionable alerts to real time intrusions and insider breaches.
